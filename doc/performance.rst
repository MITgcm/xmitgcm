Performance Issues
==================

A major goal of xmitgcm is to achieve scalable performance with very large
datasets. We were motivated by the new
`LLC4320 <file:///Users/rpa/RND/Public/xmitgcm/doc/_build/html/index.html>`_
simulations run by
`Dimitris Menemenlis <https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Menemenlis/>`_
and
`Chris Hill <https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/cnh>`_ on NASA's
`Pleiades`_ supercomputer.




Running xmitgcm on Pleaides
---------------------------

`Pleiades`_ is NASA's supercomputer. Many high-resolution MITgcm simulations
are run there. xmitgcm is an ideal solution for working with these data.
